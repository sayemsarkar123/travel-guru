This hilly area, with tea estates, lemon orchards, pineapple, and rubber plantations, is one of the most picturesque and enjoyable parts of the country. For miles around, tea estates form a perennially green carpet on the sloping hills, and it is the one area (besides the Sundarbans) where it is possible to look around and not see another human being. A few days spent around its tea estates and exploring nearby villages and forests will almost certainly rank among your most treasured experiences in Bangladesh.`,
